# Winning space race with data science
Final project of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate specialization, this Capstone course brings together all the knowledge and skills acquired throughout the previous courses. It serves as a practical summary of the entire specialization in the form of a real-world project.

SpaceX is considered the most successful company in the era of commercial space exploration, thanks to its ability to reduce the cost of space travel. On its website, the company lists Falcon 9 rocket launches at 62 million dollars, compared to more than 165 million dollars charged by other providers. A key reason for this cost advantage is that SpaceX reuses the rocket’s first stage. Therefore, predicting whether the first stage can be recovered is crucial for estimating the launch cost. Using publicly available data and machine learning models, we aim to predict if SpaceX will be able to reuse the first stage. This project explores how different factors, such as payload mass, launch site, and orbit, influence the success of SpaceX’s first stage landings. We also examine whether landing success has improved over time and aim to find the best algorithm for binary classification.
